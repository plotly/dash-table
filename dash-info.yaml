pkg_help_description: >-
    An interactive table component designed for editing and exploring
    large datasets, DataTable is rendered with standard, semantic HTML
    <table/> markup, which makes it accessible, responsive, and easy
    to style. This component was written from scratch in React.js
    specifically for the Dash community. Its API was designed to be
    ergonomic and its behaviour is completely customizable through its
    properties.
