\title{Convert data.frame objects to list-of-lists format}

\description{
Convert a \code{\link{data.frame}} to a list of lists for compatibility with \code{\link{dashDataTable}}. The function will return a nested list object in which the sublists contain named elements of varying type; the names correspond to the column names in the original \code{\link{data.frame}}.
}

\usage{
df_to_list(df=NULL)
}

\arguments{
\item{df}{A \code{data.frame} object, which will be transformed into a list of lists. Each row will become a single named list, in which the elements are named as the columns from which they were extracted.}
}

\value{
a \code{list} object, in which the sublists are named elements of varying type; the names correspond to the column names in the \code{data.frame} specified by \code{df}.
}

\examples{
# first, create data frame
df <- read.csv(url(
  'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/solar.csv'
  ),
  check.names=FALSE,
  stringsAsFactors=FALSE
)

# then convert to list-of-lists format for use in dashTable
# the following snippet below will print as JSON
# see the help for dashDataTable to see an actual app example
dashDataTable(
  id = 'table',
  columns = lapply(colnames(df), function(x) {
    list(name = x, id = x)
  }),
  data = df_to_list(df)
)
}
