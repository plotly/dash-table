# Change Log for dash-table
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
[#546](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/546)
- New prop `export_columns` that takes values `all` or `visible` (default). This prop controls the columns used during export

[#597](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/597)
- Add `is blank` unary operator. Returns true for `undefined`, `null` and `''`.

### Changed
[#598](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/598)
- Allow values with whitespaces in column filters

### Fixed
[#460](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/460)
- The `datestartswith` relational operator now supports number comparison
- Fixed a bug where the implicit operator for columns was `equal` instead of the expected default for the column type

[#546](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/546)
- Visible columns are used correctly for both header and data rows

[#591](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/591)
- Fixed row and column selection when multiple tables are present

## [4.3.0] - 2019-09-17
### Added
[#566](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/566)
- Support persisting user edits when the component or the page is reloaded. New props are `persistence`, `persistence_type`, and `persisted_props`. Set `persistence` to a truthy value to enable, the other two modify persistence behavior. See [plotly/dash#903](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/903) for more details.

[#319](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/319)
- New 'loading_state' prop that contains information about which prop, if any, is being computed.
- Table no longer allows for editing while the `data` prop is loading.

### Fixed
[#578](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/578)
- Fix [#576](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/576), editing column names or deleting columns while other columns are hidden causing the hidden columns to be lost.
- Fix an unreported bug that clicking "Cancel" at the column name edit prompt would clear the name, rather than leaving it unchanged as it should.

[#569](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/569), [#544](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/544)
- Allow empty strings in all `filter_query` (e.g filter_query: '{colA} eq ""')

[#567](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/567)
- Add support for missing `border-radius` in style_** props
- Fix table's inner vs. outer container styling

[#18](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/18)
- Fix row selection vertical and horizontal alignment

[#103](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/103)
- Simplify usage for multi-line cells and ellipsis. The cell's content now inherits the value of
`white-space`, `overflow` and `text-overflow` from its parent, making it possible to style
multi-line & ellipsis with `style_data` and other style props.

[#583](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/583)
- Fix regression when editing the content of a cell in a scrolled virtualized table

[#539](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/539)
- Fix bug where boolean values are not showing up in the table

## [4.2.0] - 2019-08-27
### Added
[#317](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/317)
- New `column.selectable` nested prop that displays a selection checkbox or radio button in the column.
- New `column_selectable` prop to choose whether columns can be selected or not, and whether a single or
    multiple selections can be in effect at the same time.
- New `selected_columns` prop that contains the list of visible and hidden columns that are currently selected
- New `derived_viewport_selected_columns` that contains the list of visible columns that are currently selected
    This prop is read-only. Use `selected_columns` in callbacks instead.

### Fixed
[#533](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/533)
- Fixed problem clearing one column shifting everything to the left and
leaving the last column blank
- Add merge_duplicate_headers prop to correct `export_format: display` behavior.
[#549](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/549)
- Fixed renaming of single-row headers in the GUI

## [4.1.0] - 2019-08-05
### Added
[#314](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/314)
- New `column.hideable` flag that displays an "eye" action icon in the column
    Accepts a boolean, array of booleans, 'last' or 'first'. Clicking on the "eye" will add the column to the `hidden_columns` prop.
    `hidden_columns` can be added back through the Columns toggle menu whether they are hideable or not.
- New accepted values for `column.clearable`, `column.deletable` and `column.renamable`
    These props now also accept 'last' and 'first'.
    - 'last' will display the action only on the last row of the headers
    - 'first' will display the action only on the first row of the headers

[#313](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/313)
- Ability to export table as csv or xlsx file.

[#497](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/497)
- New `column.clearable` flag that displays a "eraser" action in the column
    Accepts a boolean or array of booleans for multi-line headers.
    Clicking a merged column's "eraser" will clear all related columns.

    - Clearing column(s) will remove the appropriate data props from each datum
    row of `data`.
    - Additionally clearing the column will reset the filter for the affected column(s)

[#318](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/318)
- Headers are included when copying from the table to different
tabs and elsewhere. They are ignored when copying from the table onto itself and
between two tables within the same tab.

### Changed
[#497](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/497)
- Like for clearing above, deleting through the "trash" action will also
reset the filter for the affected column(s)

### Fixed
[#524](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/524)
- Fixed readonly dropdown cells content (display label, not value)

[#259](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/259)
- Fixed columns `sticky` on Safari

[#491](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/491)
- Fixed inconsistent behaviors when editing cell headers

[#521](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/521)
- Fixed white line artifacts when rendering the table with browser zoom different from 100%

## [4.0.2] - 2019-07-15
### Fixed
[#489](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/489)
- Add `fill_width` prop to replace `content_style` prop removed in the [4.0 API rework](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/446)

## [4.0.1] - 2019-07-09
### Changed
[#488](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/488)
- Update table build for use as a library and make consistent with other Dash repos

## [4.0.0] - 2019-06-20
### Changed
[#446](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/446)
- Table API rework
#### NEW
    - `column.sort_as_null`: Allows sorting behavior customization.
        Accepts an array of string, number or booleans.

#### REMOVED
    - `column.clearable`: Allows clearing the value of a dropdown cell.
        Removed in favor of `dropdown_**` `clearable` nested property.
    - `column.hidden`: Allows hiding column
        Removed. Stay tuned by following https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/314.
    - `column.options`
        Removed. Redundant with `dropdown`.
    - `content_style`
        Removed. Deemed unnecessary. NOTE - This was added back in 4.0.2 under the name the "fill_width" property name.
    - `pagination_settings`
        Replaced by two props `page_current` and `page_size`.

#### RENAMED
    - `column_static_tooltip`
        Renamed to `tooltip`.
    - `column_conditional_tooltips`
        Renamed to `tooltip_conditional`.
    - `filter`
        Renamed to `filter_query`.
    - `sort_type`
        Renamed to `sort_mode`.
    - `derived_filter_structure`
        Renamed to `derived_filter_query_structure`.

#### MODIFIED
    - `column.deletable`: Allows column deletion.
        Now accepts a boolean or an array of booleans (for multi-line headers).
        For example, if there are multiple headers and you want the second header row to be deletable, this would be `[False, True]`.
    - `column.editable_name`: Allows column renaming.
        Renamed to `column.renamable`
        Now accepts a boolean or an array of booleans (for multi-line headers).
        For example, if there are multiple headers and you want the second row's header's name to be editable, this would be `[False, True]`.
    - `column.id`
        Now accepts `string` only -- `number` column ids can be casted to string.
    - `n_fixed_columns`: Will fix columns to the left.
        Renamed to `fixed_columns`
        Now accepts an object { headers: boolean, data: number } instead of a number.
        { headers: true } determines the number of columns to fix automatically. For example, if the rows are selectable or deletable, { headers: true } would fix those columns automatically. If { headers: true, data: 2 }, it would fix the first two data columns in addition to the selectable and deletable if visible.
    - `n_fixed_rows`: Will fix rows to the top.
        Renamed to `fixed_rows`
        Now accepts an object { headers: boolean, data: number } instead of a number.
        { headers: true } determines the number of rows to fix automatically (i.e. if there are multiple headers, it will fix all of them as well as the filter row).
        { headers: true, data: 2} would fix all of the header rows as well as the first 2 data rows.
    -  `pagination_mode`
        Renamed to `page_action`.
        `'fe'` is now `'native'`, `'be'` is now `'custom'`, and `false` is now '`none'`
    -  `column_static_dropdown`
        Renamed to `dropdown`.
        Now an object with each entry refering to a Column ID. Each nested prop expects.
        `clearable` and `options`.
    - `column_conditional_dropdowns`
        Renamed to `dropdown_conditional`.
        `condition` changed to the same `if` nested prop used by styles.
        `dropdown` renamed to `options`.
    - `dropdown_properties`
        Renamed to `dropdown_data`.
        Matches the `data` structure.
    - `tooltips`
        Renamed to `tooltip_data`.
        Matches the `data` structure.
    - `filtering`
        Renamed to `filter_action`.
    - `sorting`
        Renamed to `sort_action`.
    - `sorting_treat_empty_string_as_none`
        Renamed to `sort_as_null`.
        Now accepts an array of string, number or booleans that can be ignored during sort.
        Table-level prop for the `column.sort_as_null` column nested prop.
    - `style_data_conditional`
        Renamed `filter` to `filter_query`.

    - IDs will not be displayed unless there is a column with `id='id'`
    - `active_cell`, `start_cell`, `end_cell`, and items in `selected_cells` contain row and column IDs: All are now dicts  `{'row', 'column', 'row_id' and 'column_id'}` rather than arrays `[row, column]`.

    - style_** props will ignore the following CSS rules:
        border_bottom_color, border_bottom_left_radius, border_bottom_right_radius, border_bottom_style, border_bottom_width, border_collapse, border_color, border_corner_shape, border_image_source, border_image_width, border_left_color, border_left_style, border_left_width, border_right_color, border_right_style, border_right_width, border_spacing, border_style, border_top_color, border_top_left_radius, border_top_right_radius, border_top_style, border_top_width, border_width
    - Styles priority:
        1. Props priority in decreasing order

## [3.1.0-rc6]
### Added
- Styling API refactoring

    - Remove column width / maxWidth / minWidth
    - Rename property table_style to css

    Cell: All table cells
    Data: All data driven cells (no operations, headers, filters)
    Filter: All basic filter cells
    Header: All header cells

    Priority
    Data: style_data_conditional > style_data > style_cell_conditional > style_cell
    Filter: style_filter_conditional > style_filter > style_cell_conditional > style_cell
    Header: style_header_conditional > style_header > style_cell_conditional > style_cell

    Merge Logic
    Only properties defined at a higher priority level will override properties
    defined at lower priority levels. For example if A is applied then B, A+B will be..

    A = {
        background_color: 'floralwhite',
        color: 'red',
        font_type: 'monospace',
        width: 100
    }

    B = {
        color: 'black',
        font_size: 22
    }

    A+B = {
        background_color: 'floralwhite', // from A, not overridden
        color: 'black', // from B, A overridden
        font_size: 22, // from B
        font_type: 'monospace', // from A
        width: 100 // from A
    }

    dataframe -> data
    dataframe_previous -> data_previous
    dataframe_timestamp -> data_timestamp
    derived_virtual_dataframe -> derived_virtual_data

## [3.1.0-rc5]
### Fixed
- Tests and fixes for editable/readonly [#134](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/134) [#132](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/132)

## [3.1.0-rc4]
### Added
Columns width percentage and default (fit to content) support
- Added prop content_style that takes values 'fit' or 'grow' (Default='fit')
- Added width percentage support
- Modified default column behavior from fixed width to 'fit content'
- Modified width, min-width, max-width interaction on columns

Width percentage

    Columns can now accept '%' width, minWidth, maxWidth

    For the percentages to have meaning, the dash-table must be forced to have a width and the content of the dash-table must be forced to grow to fill the available space made available by the container (by default the table is only as big as it needs to be).

    To use percentage-based column widths, add:

    - content style
        content_style='grow'

    - table style (example)
        table_style=[{ selector: '.dash-spreadsheet', rule: 'width: 100%; max-width: 100%' }]

    - column with %-based width
        columns=[{
            id: 'column',
            width: '40%'
        }]

Default column width

    Columns now default to 'fit to content' when no width is defined
    Note: If pagination is used or the dataframe modified, the column width will be re-evaluated on each modification.

Interaction between width, min-width and max-width

    Column min-width and max-width do not default to width value is not defined.

## [3.1.0-rc3]
### Fixed
- Miscellaneous fixes for pagination, virtual df and viewport df [#112](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/112)

## [3.1.0-rc2]
### Changed
- 1 new internal facing derived/controlled property:
    columns: Columns -> columns: VisibleColumns
    Gets rid of conditional processing for hidden columns in the cell and header factories as well as in navigation/selection handlers

Clean up column offsets
- A bunch of offsets were introduced to the table in the previous development cycle (2.x -> 3.0). Turns out these offsets are neither useful or necessary


Validate compatibility of filtering, sorting, pagination

External facing classes and attributes
- (ATTRIBUTE) data-dash-column=<columnId>

    .dash-cell,
    .dash-header {
        &[data-dash-column='ticker'] {
            // styling
        }
    }

- (CLASS) dash-cell
- (CLASS) dash-header

- (CLASS) dash-delete-cell
- (CLASS) dash-delete-header
- (CLASS) dash-select-cell
- (CLASS) dash-select-header

- (CLASS) dash-cell-value

- (CLASS) dash-freeze-left
- (CLASS) dash-freeze-top
- (CLASS) dash-spreadsheet
- (CLASS) dash-spreadsheet-container
- (CLASS) dash-spreadsheet-inner

## [3.1.0-rc1]
### Added
Version 3.1 of the Dash-Table builds upon the 3.0 table and solidifies the external facing API of the table
- introducing the notion of derived properties
- virtual and viewport dataframe and indices for more flexibility
- code refactoring to simplify and improve the existing implementation / prepare for the future
- documentation of the API and table features
- additional e2e, integration and unit tests for a more mature development platform

Derived Properties
- Derived properties are new to 3.1
- They are readonly properties that represent a transform from multiple 'first-class' properties of the component.
- For example, `derived_viewport_dataframe` is a readonly view based on `(dataframe, filtering params, sorting params, pagination params) --> derived_viewport_dataframe`

Derived properties allow the component to expose complex state that can be useful for a Dash Server developer but without introducing dual states, a situation where multiple properties may represent the same state within the component, making it necessary to reconcile them on each prop update.

Virtual and Viewport Dataframe
- 4 new external facing derived properties and 4 internal facing controlled properties that represent:
    1. the filtered and sorted dataframe and the indices mapping
    2. the filtered, sorted and paginated dataframe and the indices mapping

    - `derived_viewport_dataframe`
    - `derived_viewport_indices`
    - `derived_virtual_dataframe`
    - `derived_virtual_indices`

    In the event where sorting, filtering or pagination is done on the Dash server, it is possible that some or all derived dataframes will be equal to the dataframe prop.

## [3.0.0-rc22]
### Fixed
- Fix regression for user select
    Sorting arrow will no longer highlight.

## [3.0.0-rc21]
### Changed
- Improve performance when the user clicks outside of the table [#104](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/104)
    Clicking outside of the table was setting the table's `is_focused` property.
    Setting component properties in Dash can be expensive: it can cause the
    entire app to re-render.
    Now, clicking outside the table will update the component more efficiently,
    prevent excessive application re-renders.

## [3.0.0-rc20]
### Fixed
- Fix incorrect border around table cells when not filled [#102](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/102) [#101](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/101)
    Table styling has been changed for frozen rows and columns. Default styling change from:

    - frozen rows: { height: 500px } to { height: fit-content, max-height: 500px }
    - frozen columns: { width: 500px } to { width: fit-content, max-width: 500px }

## [3.0.0-rc19]
### Fixed
- Fix dropdown position & behavior on scroll [#96](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/96)
    Limitation: The dropdown in fixed columns behaves differently from the dropdown in the non-fixed portion of the table. Because of layers of overflow & positioning, the dropdown does not show outside of the table is instead part of it. Opening the dropdown in bottom rows will require scrolling vs. displaying on top of the table.

## [3.0.0-rc18]
### Added
Basic Filtering & Preparation work for advaced filtering
- Additional filtering_type prop that can take value 'basic' (or eventually 'advanced')
    This prop defines whether the user is presented with the UI to filter by column or with complex expressions
    The default value is 'basic'

    Note: The filtering row counts against n_fixed_rows

- Additional filtering_types prop that takes an array of values with valid values 'basic' (and eventually 'advanced')
    This prop defines what type of filtering are available to the user
    The default value is ['basic']

    Note: This value needs to be consistent with `filtering_type`

## [3.0.0-rc17]
### Added
- Make buttons non-selectable [#105](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/105) [#91](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/91)

### Fixed
- Empty dropdown setting value regression fix [#85](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/85) [#83](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/83)

## RC13 - Modify click & sequential click behavior
### Changed
- Partial implementation of new click & sequential click behavior [#79](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/79) [#77](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/77)
    - First click selects the cell's content and will cause user input to override the cell content.
    - Second click into the cell will remove the selection and position the cursor accordingly.

## [3.0.0-rc12]
### Fixed
- Fix border style [#78](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/78) [#68](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/68)
- Fix selection [#78](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/78) [#73](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/73)
- Fix row offset [#78](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/78) [#76](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/76)

## [3.0.0-rc10]
### Fixed
- Fix double click regression [#63](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/pull/63)

## [3.0.0-rc9]
### Added
Treat empty strings as none
- sorting_treat_empty_string_as_none takes value True or False
    Overrides sorting default behavior to consider empty strings as a nully value.
    Note: This is a stopgag prop, full implementation of sorting overrides will most probably deprecate it.
    Default value is False.

## [3.0.0-rc8]
### Fixed
setProps bug fix
- Fixing initialization issue where the FE wrongly believes it's working in DEV mode

## [3.0.0-rc7]
### Added
Additional `sorting_type` prop that can take value 'multi' or 'single'
This prop defines whether the user can sort based on multiple columns or can only sort by one column at a time. The default value is 'single'.

## [3.0.0-rc6]
### Added
Consolidating virtualization, sorting, filtering
- First steps to make sorting work from both FE and BE *
- and consistent with Virtualization settings *

New Props
- sorting -> ['fe', 'be', true, false] (default: false) -- replaces `sortable` prop
- sorting_settings -> array of { field, ascending } -- replaces `sort` prop
- `virtual_dataframe` (READONLY)
- `virtual_dataframe_indices` (READONLY; not officially supported yet -- IN DEVELOPMENT)

virtual_dataframe vs. dataframe
- the virtual dataframe is the content of the viewport for the user (e.g. user has a 10k rows dataframe with FE/250 lines paging, on 1st page -> the `virtual_dataframe` contains items [0,250[ of the dataframe); the dataframe still contains 10k items
- 10k rows, no paging, sorting and filtering -> the virtual dataframe contains items visible in the viewport, in the visible order; the dataframe still contains 10k items
- if the user modifies a cell, the dataframe and the virtual_dataframe are updated with the new data

### Deprecated
- sortable
- sort
- dataframe behavior on sort (see below)

## [3.0.0-rc5]
### Added
New props for Conditional Style, Conditional Dropdown, Filter
- filtering -> ['fe', 'be', true, false] (default: false)
- filtering_settings -> AST query string (default: '')
- column_conditional_dropdowns
- column_static_dropdown
- column_conditional_styles
- column_static_style
- row_conditional_styles
- row_static_style

### Deprecated
- column style
- column options
- dropdown_properties prop

## [3.0.0-rc4]
### Added
Version 3.0 of the Dash-Table expands vastly on the capability of the 2.x table and provides features:
- visually freezing rows and/or columns
- filtering in either FE or BE, basic filtering UI
- sorting in either FE or BE, basic sorting UI
- pagination in either FE or BE, basic pagination UI
- performance optimizations
- basic coverage through e2e, integration and unit tests

Virtualization
- See v_be_page_usage.py and v_fe_page_usage.py for FE and BE usage scenarios.
- virtual_dataframe and virtual_dataframe_indices are exposed and expected to be *readonly*. Setting them from the BE will have no impact on the FE display.
FE Virtualization
- BE is not expected to update the dataframe when the virtualization settings are updated.

BE Virtualization
- BE is expected to update the dataframe when the virtualization settings are updated.

Freeze Top Rows (Limitations)
- the table styling is forced to { table-layout: fixed; width: 0 !important; } to ensure the frozen section and the rest of the table stay in sync (width-wise); this means that the width of the table is only driven by the width of the columns (default width is 200px)
- can't freeze rows and columns at the same time

Freeze Left Columns (Limitations)
- performance is highly impacted if the table is in a scrollable container as the frozen columns position has to be recalculated on each scroll event; impact is minimal up to 50-100 items and makes the table difficult to use with 250-500 items
- can't freeze rows and columns at the same time
- when using merged headers, make sure that the number of fixed columns respects the merged headers, otherwise there will be some unresolved visual bugs/artifacts
- rows are assumed to all have the same height

Deletable Columns (Limitations)
- there might be unintended side-effects if used with BE virtualization (the act of deleting a column / columns modifies the dataframe)

Performance Improvements
- Table now renders and navigates faster
- Typing in cell does not modify dataframe until focus is lost / edit is confirmed ("enter" or "tab)

### Deprecated
- prop "update_on_unfocus" has been removed
